# **Level 1: Web Form**
## This is my first assignment at Saleshandy.

### In this assignment I will be creating a simple responsive web form, using only **HTML, CSS and Plain JavaScript**. 

### The form will contain following feilds:
* First name
* Last name
* Email Address
* Date of Birth
* Gender

The end point to store data for this form is the local storage of the browser. 

### To run this project install Live Server extension to your VS Code and click on Go Live at your bottom right corner of the IDE.
